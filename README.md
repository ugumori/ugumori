## Achievements
### Refactoring applications written in Vue.js Options API to Composition API
The difficulty of reusability and testing of the Options API and the complexity of code due to its large size have caused a decline in development productivity, and the Composition API was adopted to address these issues. By taking advantage of the characteristics of function-based APIs, logic reuse and testing became easier, and code readability was improved. This greatly improved maintainability and development efficiency.
In addition, hands-on training using actual code was provided to team members to facilitate a smoother transition to the Composition API for the entire team.
